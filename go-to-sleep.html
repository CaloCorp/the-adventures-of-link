        <hr>
        <p> Yawning, you tuck yourself in. You toss and you turn a multiple of times. After what feels like an hour, you finally find a comfy posistion.</p>
        <p>For a brief moment you feel uneasy, as if there someone watching you.</p>
        <p> You pass out anyway, falling into deep sleep. </p>
        <p> You awake to find yourself in a library. A strange sense of familiarity creeps over you.</p>
