    <hr>
    <p><strong>"Incindio Totallum"</strong> you yell. As soon as the words escape you feel a <i> strange sensation</i></p>
    <p>Your stomach starts feeling extremely warm and that feeling travels up into your chest</p>
    <p>Getting even hotter it travels up your throat and becomes <strong> UNBEARABLE</strong></p>
    <p> You cough hard and exhale. A stream of blue fire five times the size of your head jets from your mouth!!</p>
    <p>Unable to close you mouth you look on in terror as everything in front of you is burned to a crisp</p>
    <p>The librarian is instantly liquifyed. The fire is quickly burning people and books a alike. </p>
    <p> theres nothing you can do as the place burns down around you and realize this place will become your grave...</p>
