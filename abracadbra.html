    <h1>Abracadabra!!!</h1>
    <hr>
    <strong>ABRACADABRA!!</strong> you yell from from the top of your lungs. <strong>Nothing happens.</strong>
    <p>Some people in library are giving you dirty looks. Some of them are laughing at you</p>
    <p>You see the librarian approaching, her are eyes squinted in your direction and you know shes about to say something to you </p>
    <p>What in the world made you think the word "abracadabra" would even do anything?</p>
    <p>maybe one of the other two words does something, but now which one?</p>
